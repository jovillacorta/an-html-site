        <h2>Arcade hero is an embedded systems project. I used an Atmel 1284p 
            controller and AVR studio 7 to build it. Project scripts were
            written in c.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            Arcade hero is a music-rhythm game and a simplified version of Guitar hero.
            Basic push buttons were used for the guitar fret buttons, and a joystick
            was used for the strum function. The game communicates via an LCD screen display. 
            A piezo buzzer plays the music and an 8x8 LED Matrix displays the falling notes.
            The player is scored on accuracy.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            The hands-on nature of this project made it one of the most fun games I have 
            built thus far. I'd love to make another music based embedded system project.
