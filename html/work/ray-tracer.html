        <h2>For this project, we were given the skeleton code in C++, 
            and wrote each ray-tracing function into the project.
        </h2>
        <h2>Examples of basic ray-tracing functions that we covered include
            ray intersection, color calculations, shadows, 
            relective shading, phong shading, and more.
        </h2>
        <h2>I did this project without realizing I would be so
            heavily invested in 3D world building as an adult. This project
            was a great way to understand exactly how those 3D worlds
            are rendered using basic physics and math.
