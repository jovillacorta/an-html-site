            Hello World a multi-level RPG pixel art game. Our player wakes up in a post
            apocalyptic world where rogue robots have taken over. The objective
            of the game is to fight these robots, and with each successful fight, 
            the opposing robot will join your team.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            Features include basic character movement, fight scenes, item inventory, 
            character health and XP stats, story board, and save functions.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            This project only got as far as one level due to the 10 week constraint of 
            our class, but I would love to revisit this project and build more levels
        </h2>
        <h2>
            A lot of art also went into this particular project 
            (including custom music). My contributions to the artwork can be found
